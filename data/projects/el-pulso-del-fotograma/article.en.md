For two months, from October to November 2019, the Giant Camera of the
Andalusian Photography Center hosted the cycle of short films El pulso del
fotograma, a cycle curated by the Festival of Contemporary Animation of Mexico
City (ANIMASIVO) in collaboration with La Periférica , with the aim of showing
the capacity of the animated image to subvert and reinvent discourses, as well
as to explore aesthetics and narrative imagery.

A journey through a selection of independent works made from found photographs,
from the recovery of similar techniques, the magic lantern and the prototype
slide, to the application of the most current digital techniques. A journey to
understand the germ of contemporary animated cinema and discover how photography
and image expand when intervened, come to life and acquire movement, giving rise
to animation and unexpected audiovisual languages ​​to narrate
reality.

The cycle featured 11 international works by international directors and
directors, highlighting the short Cazatalentos, by José Herrera from Almería,
winner of a Goya award.

ANIMASIVO was born in 2008 as the first space dedicated exclusively to animation
cinema in Mexico and during these years it has become a platform of visual
resistance giving visibility to unpublished, independent and author animation
works. A leading festival in Latin America, ANIMASIVO has established itself as
an exhibition and dissemination platform, promoting the training, production and
research of Latin American and international animation. Furthermore, since 2014,
it has promoted Animæntary, the first specific call for animated documentary
films in Latin America.

An initiative of the Imaginar Cultural Association is Resistir and Colectivo La
Periférica, and ANIMASIVO - Festival of Contemporary Animation in Mexico City.

Organized by the Andalusian Agency for Cultural Institutions at the headquarters
of the Andalusian Center for Photography of the Ministry of Culture and
Historical Heritage of the Junta de Andalucía.
