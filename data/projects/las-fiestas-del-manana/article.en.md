In collaboration with the La Periférica Association and the Almería Museum
(Junta de Andalucía), on July 26 we presented Co-responsible for a program of
social cinema, talk and colloquium on audiovisuals for social change and
everything that the projected materials inspire us . The radio station Las
Fiestas del Mañana (broadcast on the municipal radio station Candil Radio de
Huércal de Almería) held its first “minifestival” on Saturday October 19, 2019.
With the intention of consolidating it annually, the event brought together 3
Independent rock and pop artists in the Madchester room in Almería.

The highlight was the jiennenses Uniforms, who visited Almería for the first
time to close the tour for the presentation of “Polara”, their first album: a
sample of melodies covered in space atmospheres and distorted guitars. Two local
bands also performed: the fireproof Loudly, with his emotional rock guided by
the poetry of J. A. Góngora, and the autumnal The Oldest Radio Show, the
pseudonym that Fernando Manzano uses to display his author repertoire.

The night continued with some DJs from Almería such as Cactus Loren and the
director of the Las Fiestas del Mañana program.
