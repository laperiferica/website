Las Fiestas del Mañana radio show (broadcasted on Candil Radio, the local radio station from Huércal de Almería) organized its first “mini-festival” on October 19th. The idea is to consolidate this event yearly. Three indie rock and pop bands joined that Saturday in Almería Madchester Club.

The headliner was Jaén-based band Uniforms, that came to Almería for their first time and finished their tour there. Uniforms presented “Polara”, their first album. It’s an ensemble of melodies coated with space atmospheres and distorted guitars. There were also 2 local bands: Loudly and their emo rock guided by J.A. Góngora’s lyrics, and The Oldest Radio Show, the Fernando Manzano’s A.K.A. that he uses to show their music poetries.

The night continued with some DJs from Almería such as Cactus Loren and the Las Fiestas del Mañana’s presenter.
