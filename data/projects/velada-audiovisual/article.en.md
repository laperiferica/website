In support of our friends from [CIC Batá](http://www.cicbata.org), the
collective La Periférica managed the arrival in Almería of the audiovisual
evenings for the presentation of Corresponsables. Under this name is a project
that promotes audiovisual language and communication for social change in
Andalusia.

On the night of July 26, 2018, CIC Batá presented Corresponsables in the Plaza
del [Museo de Almería](http://www.museosdeandalucia.es/web/museodealmeria). with
an introductory talk in which the project was announced. The objective is based
on favoring the creation of groups that reflect and act around the audiovisual
for social change, proposing it from the perspective of the right to
communication to promote new narratives.

That summer night, 5 short films were shown, some of them the result of meetings
of collective creation carried out by CIC Batá. Among the dozens of attendees
were audiovisual filmmakers such as Juanjo Moya and members of the Invisible
Cities collective. Together with them, together with the management of La
Periférica and the collaboration of the Almería Museum, they achieved one of the
objectives of this audiovisual evening: the creation of synergies between CIC
Batá with social organizations, the media and creators audiovisuals.
