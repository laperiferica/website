As a support to our friends of [CIC Batá](http://www.cicbata.org/), La Periférica managed the arrival in Almería of “veladas audiovisuales” (audiovisual evenings) and the presentation of Corresponsables (a mix between “correspondent” and “responsible”). Corresponsables is a project that promotes the use of audiovisuals and communication for social change in Andalusia.

The evening of July 26th, 2018, CIC Batá presented Corresponsables in the Museo de Almería’s square with an introducing chat. The target is to favor the creation of groups in order to think and act about audiovisuals to social change, having in mind the right to communication and the new filming narratives.

That summer evening 5 short movies were played, some of them came from those creation meetings arranged by CIC Batá. Among tens of assistants, there were filmmakers such as Juanjo Moya and members from associations like [Ciudades Invisibles](https://www.facebook.com/Ciudades-Invisibles-353172605493472/). They, plus La Periférica and the [Museo de Almería](http://www.museosdeandalucia.es/web/museodealmeria), accomplished the objectives of this “velada audiovisual”: generating synergies between CIC Batá, social organizations, mass media and filmmakers.
