We are a group of Cultural Managers from Almería that seeks to value cultural
life from an innovative vision.

La Periférica is a launch pad for projects that foster and promote talent and
creativity, the exchange of experiences and cultural cooperation.

Through artistic and cultural projects, our own and in collaboration with
others, we intend to activate citizen involvement and participation, as well as
reflection and action on contemporary challenges and issues. We comprise the
different aspects of contemporary art and culture (audiovisuals, music,
performing arts, anthropology, ecology, feminism, queer movement ...) as tools
for social transformation and as vehicles for citizen mutual understanding and
cohesion. Thanks to the fact that we are a multidisciplinary and specialized
team in different areas of the cultural and creative sector, and with
extensive experience in cooperation and the third sector, both nationally and
internationally, we have managed to take different actions such as the 
conceptualization of our own programs and projects, cultural management and 
production, as well as the promotion of contemporary creation.

As "cultural agitators", from La Periférica, we conceive each project as a new
seed to create, from horizontality and collaboration, a better world for
everyone. Promoting environmental and social sustainability we want to
contribute to greater solidarity, at the glocal level. All these values
are transversal to the projects we carry out, from the contents to the management itself.

La Periférica always works as a team, in a democratic way, exercising
listening as the main work tool. [We team up](/conexions), whenever possible,
with other networks of professionals and institutions, associations,
groups, initiatives and projects with which we share visions, values and
ways of doing to achieve objectives. Furthermore, we work with numerous public
institutions with which our interests come together.
