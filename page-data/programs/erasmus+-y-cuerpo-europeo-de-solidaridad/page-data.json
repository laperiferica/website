The European Solidarity Corps officially became operational in December 2017. After a simple registration process, participants may be selected to join a whole series of projects. The projects of the European Solidarity Corps will be carried out by organizations duly accredited and authorized to carry them out.</p>\n<p>ESC is a non-formal educational activity that allows young people <strong>between the\nages of 18 and 30</strong> to express their personal commitment through a <strong>long-term\nvoluntary service with the costs paid</strong>. Projects can be of community interest,\nin the social, environmental or cultural field. People between <strong>18 to 30 years\nold</strong> can participate, who want to dedicate their free time to solidarity\ncauses, motivated to discover other cultures and live closely with people from\nother countries. You can apply for the European Solidarity Corps projects as\nlong as you are <strong>30 years old at the start of the project</strong>.</p>\n<p>It is a <strong>voluntary service with costs paid</strong>. It is full time, for a minimum of\n2 and a maximum of 12 months depending on the project, and always in a different\ncountry from your own, whether within the European Union or outside it. The\nEuropean Solidarity Corps projects are carried out <strong>throughout the year</strong>. You\ncan request participation in a long-term project (ex: 10 months) even if you\nhave already completed a short-term project (in this case, 2 months, to reach\nthe 12-month limit). It cannot be done backwards. Volunteers improve or acquire\nskills for their personal, educational and professional development. Their\nscholarships are awarded by the European Commission in order for young Europeans\nto carry out a voluntary activity. The ESC is developed through activities\norganized in collaboration between legally established organizations that send\nor host volunteers.</p>\n<p><strong>The ESC program includes:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The cost of round-trip transportation to and from the country of origin </li>\n<li>Accommodation and food expenses during the project period</li>\n<li>An amount of pocket money (varies according to the cost of living of the host country) </li>\n<li>Health insurance during the months of volunteering </li>\n<li>Online language training in the language of the host country </li>\n<li>Personalized tutoring with a responsible person in the host project</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The following are part of the project:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Voluntary person</strong>. Volunteer between the ages of 18 and 30 who wants to\nparticipate in a long-term volunteer project with expenses paid.</p>\n<p><strong>Host Organization</strong>. It is an organization in a European country that has a\nproject of social, cultural or environmental interest where it has European\nvolunteers for its development.</p>\n<p><strong>Support Organization</strong>. It is an organization in the country of the volunteer\nthat accompanies the volunteer throughout the process: training, monitoring and\nevaluation. La Periférica is an accredited organization for the support of\nEuropean volunteers, contact us and we will facilitate the process of sending\nyou to your favorite project.</p>\n<p>ESC has three official calls in February, April, and October but you can get a\nproject throughout the year. You will be able to find projects in all the\ncountries of the European Union. In the following link you can find all the\nprojects that volunteers are looking for right now:\n<a href=\"http://europa.eu/youth/volunteering/project_en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://europa.eu/youth/volunteering/project_en</a></p>\n<p>The ESC <strong>has no costs for volunteers, it is free</strong>, although in some cases they\nhave to buy the plane tickets themselves, which in all cases will be reimbursed\nby the host organization. The program covers the cost of round-trip flights to\nand from the country of origin; accommodation and food expenses during the\nproject period; an amount of pocket money (varies according to the cost of\nliving of the host country).</p>\n<p><strong>Each project has different characteristics</strong>. Accommodation is specified in\nthe description of each volunteer project. It varies a lot: Room in a shared\nhouse with other volunteers, shared double room, independent house for the\nvolunteer ... each project has its own characteristics, although all of them\nhave to meet some minimum requirements for it to be a home worthy.</p>\n<p><strong>Each project has different characteristics</strong>. In some cases you may be with\nmore European volunteers in the host organization, in other cases they may be\nlocal volunteers or you may be the only person volunteering in the European\nproject. In all cases you will have a tutor from the host organization who will\naccompany and guide you throughout the process. The ESC is a great opportunity\nfor integration with the local community through volunteering, making each\nexperience unique and each format unrepeatable.</p>\n<p>The ESC has <strong>specific insurance for the volunteer</strong> throughout the project\nthroughout the world, which begins on the day of departure and ends two months\nafter the return. During these two months, the insurance will only be valid in\nthe two sending and receiving countries.</p>\n<p>The language of the project is <strong>specified in the project description</strong> although\nin many of the projects English is requested as the language. In some specific\ncases, a specific level of the local language may be requested (such as in\nsocial volunteering with local people or volunteering in communication issues,\nfor example). In case a project is interested in your profile, it will have a\nSkype interview to get to know you a little better and see your required\nlanguage level. However, the ESC offers online language training in the language\nof the host country.</p>\n<p><strong>How do I apply for a ESC volunteer?</strong> Contact us and we will help you out!</p>\n<p>More information on the European Solidarity Corps program:\n<a href=\"http://www.cuerpoeuropeodesolidaridad.injuve.es/es\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://www.cuerpoeuropeodesolidaridad.injuve.es/es</a></p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"erasmus+-y-cuerpo-europeo-de-solidaridad","language":"en","intl":{"language":"en","languages":["en","es"],"messages":{"Who we are":"Who we are","Projects":"Projects","Conexions":"Conexions","Contact":"Contact","Stand out...":"Stand out...","Know us better...":"Know us better...","Latest Projects":"Latest Projects","Team Contact":"Team Contact","Home":"Home","Posts":"Posts","Team":"Team","not-found-message":"You just hit a route that doesn't exist... the sadness.","Not Found":"Not Found","Go Home":"Go Home","Tags":"Tags","Published on":"Published on","Share on your social networks":"Share on your social networks","Erasmus+/CES":"Erasmus+/CES","Inside of the program:":"Inside of the program:","Related Projects":"Related Projects","We love it":"We love it","We collaborate with":"We collaborate with","We belong to":"We belong to","Networks":"Networks","(We are members)":"(We are members)","Collaborators":"Collaborators","Privacy Policy":"Privacy Policy","Cookies Policy":"Cookies Policy","Collaborate":"Collaborate","We use cookies to improve your experience on our website.":"We use cookies to improve your experience on our website.","By browsing our site you accept the use of cookies.":"By browsing our site you accept the use of cookies.","Read more about our {link}.":"Read more about our {link}.","Accept":"Accept"},"routed":false,"originalPath":"/programs/erasmus+-y-cuerpo-europeo-de-solidaridad","redirect":true,"defaultLanguage":"en"}}}}
