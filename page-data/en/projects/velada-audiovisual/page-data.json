Corresponsables is a project that promotes the use of audiovisuals and communication for social change in Andalusia.</p>\n<p>The evening of July 26th, 2018, CIC Batá presented Corresponsables in the Museo de Almería’s square with an introducing chat. The target is to favor the creation of groups in order to think and act about audiovisuals to social change, having in mind the right to communication and the new filming narratives.</p>\n<p>That summer evening 5 short movies were played, some of them came from those creation meetings arranged by CIC Batá. Among tens of assistants, there were filmmakers such as Juanjo Moya and members from associations like <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Ciudades-Invisibles-353172605493472/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ciudades Invisibles</a>. They, plus La Periférica and the <a href=\"http://www.museosdeandalucia.es/web/museodealmeria\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Museo de Almería</a>, accomplished the objectives of this “velada audiovisual”: generating synergies between CIC Batá, social organizations, mass media and filmmakers.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"velada-audiovisual","language":"en","intl":{"language":"en","languages":["en","es"],"messages":{"Who we are":"Who we are","Projects":"Projects","Conexions":"Conexions","Contact":"Contact","Stand out...":"Stand out...","Know us better...":"Know us better...","Latest Projects":"Latest Projects","Team Contact":"Team Contact","Home":"Home","Posts":"Posts","Team":"Team","not-found-message":"You just hit a route that doesn't exist... the sadness.","Not Found":"Not Found","Go Home":"Go Home","Tags":"Tags","Published on":"Published on","Share on your social networks":"Share on your social networks","Erasmus+/CES":"Erasmus+/CES","Inside of the program:":"Inside of the program:","Related Projects":"Related Projects","We love it":"We love it","We collaborate with":"We collaborate with","We belong to":"We belong to","Networks":"Networks","(We are members)":"(We are members)","Collaborators":"Collaborators","Privacy Policy":"Privacy Policy","Cookies Policy":"Cookies Policy","Collaborate":"Collaborate","We use cookies to improve your experience on our website.":"We use cookies to improve your experience on our website.","By browsing our site you accept the use of cookies.":"By browsing our site you accept the use of cookies.","Read more about our {link}.":"Read more about our {link}.","Accept":"Accept"},"routed":true,"originalPath":"/projects/velada-audiovisual","redirect":true,"defaultLanguage":"en"}}}}
