We understand the\ndifferent facets of contemporary art and culture (audiovisuals, music,\nperforming arts, anthropology, ecology, feminism, queer movement ...) as tools\nfor social transformation and as vehicles for citizen understanding and\ncohesion. Thanks to the fact that we are a multidisciplinary and specialized\nteam in different fields of the cultural and creative sector, and with\nextensive experience in cooperation and the third sector, both nationally and\ninternationally, we have managed to make La Periférica cover different lines of\naction, from the conceptualization of own programs and projects, cultural\nmanagement and production, as well as the dissemination and promotion of\ncontemporary creation.</p>\n<p>As cultural agitators, from La Periférica we conceive each project as a new\nseed to create, from horizontality and collaboration, a better world for\neveryone, promoting environmental and social sustainability we want to\ncontribute to greater solidarity, at the glocal level. All these values\n​​cross and are transversal to the projects we carry out, from the\ncontents to the management itself.</p>\n<p>At La Periférica we always work as a team, in a democratic way, exercising\nlistening as the main work tool. <a href=\"/website/friends\">We partner</a>, whenever possible,\nwith other networks of professionals and institutions, associations,\ncollectives, initiatives and projects with which we share visions, values and\nways of doing to achieve objectives. Furthermore, we work with numerous public\ninstitutions with which our interests converge.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"language":"en","intl":{"language":"en","languages":["en","es"],"messages":{"Who we are":"Who we are","Projects":"Projects","Friends":"Friends","Contact":"Contact","Stand out...":"Stand out...","Know us better...":"Know us better...","Latest Projects":"Latest Projects","Team Contact":"Team Contact","Home":"Home","Posts":"Posts","Team":"Team","not-found-message":"You just hit a route that doesn't exist... the sadness.","Not Found":"Not Found","Go Home":"Go Home","Tags":"Tags","Published on":"Published on","Share on your social networks":"Share on your social networks","Erasmus+/CES":"Erasmus+ y CES","Inside of the program:":"Inside of the program:","Related Projects":"Related Projects","We Love":"We Love","Networks":"Networks","(We are members)":"(We are members)","Collaborators":"Collaborators","Privacy Policy":"Privacy Policy","Cookies Policy":"Cookies Policy"},"routed":false,"originalPath":"/who/","redirect":true,"defaultLanguage":"en"}}}}
