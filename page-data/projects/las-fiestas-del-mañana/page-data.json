The idea is to consolidate this event yearly. Three indie rock and pop bands joined that Saturday in Almería <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MADCHESTERCLUB/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Madchester Club</a>.</p>\n<p>The headliner was Jaén-based band Uniforms, that came to Almería for their first time and finished their tour there. Uniforms presented “Polara”, their first album. It’s an ensemble of melodies coated with space atmospheres and distorted guitars. There were also 2 local bands: Loudly and their emo rock guided by J.A. Góngora’s lyrics, and The Oldest Radio Show, the Fernando Manzano’s A.K.A. that he uses to show their music poetries.</p>\n<p>The night continued with some DJs from Almería such as Cactus Loren and the Las Fiestas del Mañana’s presenter.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"las-fiestas-del-mañana","language":"en","intl":{"language":"en","languages":["en","es"],"messages":{"Who we are":"Who we are","Projects":"Projects","Conexions":"Conexions","Contact":"Contact","Stand out...":"Stand out...","Know us better...":"Know us better...","Latest Projects":"Latest Projects","Team Contact":"Team Contact","Home":"Home","Posts":"Posts","Team":"Team","not-found-message":"You just hit a route that doesn't exist... the sadness.","Not Found":"Not Found","Go Home":"Go Home","Tags":"Tags","Published on":"Published on","Share on your social networks":"Share on your social networks","Erasmus+/CES":"Erasmus+/CES","Inside of the program:":"Inside of the program:","Related Projects":"Related Projects","We love it":"We love it","We collaborate with":"We collaborate with","We belong to":"We belong to","Networks":"Networks","(We are members)":"(We are members)","Collaborators":"Collaborators","Privacy Policy":"Privacy Policy","Cookies Policy":"Cookies Policy","Collaborate":"Collaborate","We use cookies to improve your experience on our website.":"We use cookies to improve your experience on our website.","By browsing our site you accept the use of cookies.":"By browsing our site you accept the use of cookies.","Read more about our {link}.":"Read more about our {link}.","Accept":"Accept"},"routed":false,"originalPath":"/projects/las-fiestas-del-mañana","redirect":true,"defaultLanguage":"en"}}}}
